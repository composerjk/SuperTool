SuperTool
=========

SuperTool is a plugin for the Glyphs font editor which provides:

* Curvature visualisation
* Harmonization
* Path simplification
* Tunni line manipulation
* Balancing
* Stem thickness visualisation

The best way to install it is through the Glyphs plugin manager.

The Tunni curve manipulation algorithm was first described by typeface designer Eduardo Tunni in the mid 2000s, and the first implementation was by Andrés Torresi as a FontLab 5 python script in 2012.
Andrés had studied under Eduardo at the University of Buenos Aries in the FADU Masters programme.
The Tunni Line and Tunni Point user interfaces were first described by Adam Twardoch and implemented by Yuri Yamola as a FontLab 6 feature in 2015. 

The curvature visualization user interface is commonly called a "comb" and [opinion varies](https://typedrawers.com/discussion/1487/curvature-combs) on how useful this visualization is.
The first implementation of curve combs in a font editor was by Yanone in his Speedpunk plugin for RoboFont, which he later ported to Glyphsapp.
FontLab 6 also implements this feature.

The SuperTool project was initiated by Simon Cozens in 2016 and distributed as a proprietary Glyphsapp plugin with per seat licensing until 2019, when the copyright was acquired by Google and made available under the libre Apache 2 license.
This is not an officially supported Google product, and Google provides no support.
